# COMPILING:
################################################

Just type "make".
Make sure to have a reasonably recent compiler. Note that lapack is called for computing eigenvalues 
sometimes: this may crash if compiled with some versions of GCC. GCC 6.3.0 and 9.2.0 seem working fine.
For VKI machines: 
module load gcc/9.2.0

# TODO:
################################################
Substitute numbers "1.0e.." with "1.0d...". "e" is single precision, "d" is double.

# PDE systems
################################################

Euler system has 4 equations:
rho    --- density
rho ux --- x-momentum
rho uy --- y-momentum
rho E  --- total energy

# GRID
################################################

The solution U has dimension U(N_EQ, N_cells), and includes the two ghost cells (GC).
Numbering of cells and interfaces is as follows:

   
         cell1     int1   cell2    int2   cell3   int3          intN     cellN
    ----(GC_1)------|------(C)------|------(C)-----|--- (...) ---|------(GC_N)----
                  x_min                                        x_max
    
N_cells     = total number of cells
N_cells - 2 = number of physical cells
N_int = N_cells - 1 = number of interfaces

First and last interfaces coincide with the limits of the domain, x_min, x_max

# HOW to add a PDE - say "my_pde_123"
################################################

1) copy an existing PDE module such as pde_euler.f90 to pde_my_pde_123.f90.
2) write inside it the relevant functions (copy Euler)
3) Load it into the pde.f90 module, with: "USE PDE_MY_PDE"
4) Include it in the Makefile (the pde.f90 module will need it)
5) Introduce a global bool variable in the gobal.f90, such as my_pde_123_BOOL
6) In the initialization file, insert a line that activates this bool when the
   input file is read, AND set in the same place the number of equations...
7) In the pde.f90, put the system boolean in the IF THEN ELSE statements
8) I think you should be good to go.

# FAQ
################################################

Q: ** On entry to DGEBAL parameter number  3 had an illegal value
A: This comes from lapack and you are probably trying to compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian.
   Probably the solution is weird or has crashed at a certain timestep, so the eigenvalues 
   computation also crashes, with this message.
   Try a smaller timestep.
