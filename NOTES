PROBABLY I NEED BETTER WAVESPEEDS!!!!!!!!!! 
(It crashes where u \approx 0, so where "a" matters the most in the wavespeeds..)

NOTES:
It crashes even if I pump up n and P by a factor 10000, at the very same spot. Therefore it's not numerical bad conditioning.

Reaches sigma = 1.0d0

The wavespeed is computed using Pxx only. Try using (Pxx+Pyy+Pzz)/3
